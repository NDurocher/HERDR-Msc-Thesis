## HERDR
[Autonomous Urban Environment Navigation Using Reinforcement 
Learning](./Submitted_Thesis.pdf).

## Motivation
The project was completed for my Master's thesis at the [University of Southern Denmark](https://www.sdu.dk/en), in collaboration with [Capra Robotics ApS](https://capra.ooo/). The goal of the project is to investigate a method for autonomous navigation for Capra's first production vehicle - Hircus.

## Features
This project focused on enabling the Hircus to navigate crowded urban spaces while respecting human social norms, using reinforcement learning and a deep learning model to predict unsafe situations from visual input alone.

## Credits
This work is heavily influenced by previous research from Gregory Kahn and the [Berkeley AI Research](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) (BAIR) lab at the University of California, Berkeley. Specifically, this work extends their [BADGR](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.05700.pdf) and [LaND](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.04689.pdf) methodologies. Additionally, this work would not have been possible without the initiative computation resource support and equipment access from [Capra Robotics ApS](https://capra.ooo/).
